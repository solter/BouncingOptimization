# BouncingOptimization
Program to shoot bouncing projectiles at a target.

This package solves the following problem:
Given a piecewise planar surface (defined by mesh of x,y,z points),
a tosser on the surface (at an x,y point), and a reciever (at an x,y point),
along with the number of bounces to take (N), find the angle the tosser must
launch the ball to hit the reciever.

This will be done via an optimization routine.
